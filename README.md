# DHT-MQ-LDR Sensor Data Acquisition and Processing System

This project demonstrates a system for acquiring and processing data from a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, an MQ-2 smoke sensor, and an LDR (light-dependent resistor).  The data is then processed and potentially sent to a remote server (implementation not included in this basic example).

## Hardware Components:

* **DHT11:** Temperature and humidity sensor.
* **MQ-2:** Smoke sensor.
* **LDR:** Light-dependent resistor.
* **Microcontroller:**  (Specify the microcontroller used, e.g., Arduino Uno, ESP32)  This will influence the specific code and libraries needed.

## Software Components:

* **Microcontroller Firmware:** (Specify the programming language, e.g., Arduino IDE with C++).  The firmware reads data from the sensors, processes it (e.g., calibration, filtering), and formats it for transmission.
* **(Optional) Data Processing/Visualization:**  A separate script or application (e.g., Python with libraries like matplotlib or a web application) can be used to receive, process, and visualize the sensor data.
* **(Optional) Remote Server:**  A server (e.g., using a cloud platform like AWS IoT Core or a self-hosted solution) can be used to store and manage the sensor data.

## Project Structure:

(Describe the structure of the project's files and folders.  For example:  `src/` for source code, `data/` for sensor data, `docs/` for documentation.)

## Getting Started:
(Provide instructions on how to set up and run the project.  Include details on installing libraries, connecting hardware, and compiling/uploading the firmware.)
